Action Replay Code - Explanation

  32-bit (Constant RAM Writes)
  0XXXXXXX YYYYYYYY
  Writes word YYYYYYYY to [XXXXXXX+offset].

  16-bit (Constant RAM Writes)
  1XXXXXXX 0000YYYY
  Writes halfword YYYY to [XXXXXXX+offset].

  8-bit (Constant RAM Writes)
  2XXXXXXX 000000YY
  Writes byte YY to [XXXXXXX+offset].

  Greater Than (Conditional 32-Bit Code Types)
  3XXXXXXX YYYYYYYY
  Checks if YYYYYYYY > (word at [XXXXXXX])
  If not, the code(s) following this one are not executed (ie. execution status is set to false) until a code type D0 or D2 is encountered, or until the end of the code list is reached.

  Less Than (Conditional 32-Bit Code Types)
  4XXXXXXX YYYYYYYY
  Checks if YYYYYYYY < (word at [XXXXXXX])
  If not, the code(s) following this one are not executed (ie. execution status is set to false) until a code type D0 or D2 is encountered, or until the end of the code list is reached.

  Equal To (Conditional 32-Bit Code Types)
  5XXXXXXX YYYYYYYY
  Checks if YYYYYYYY == (word at [XXXXXXX])
  If not, the code(s) following this one are not executed (ie. execution status is set to false) until a code type D0 or D2 is encountered, or until the end of the code list is reached.

  Not Equal To (Conditional 32-Bit Code Types)
  6XXXXXXX YYYYYYYY
  Checks if YYYYYYYY != (word at [XXXXXXX])
  If not, the code(s) following this one are not executed (ie. execution status is set to false) until a code type D0 or D2 is encountered, or until the end of the code list is reached.

  Greater Than (Conditional 16-Bit + Masking RAM "Writes") (but WRITING has nothing to do with this)
  7XXXXXXX ZZZZYYYY
  Checks if (YYYY) > (not (ZZZZ) & halfword at [XXXX]).
  If not, the code(s) following this one are not executed (ie. execution status is set to false) until a code type D0 or D2 is encountered, or until the end of the code list is reached.

  Less Than (Conditional 16-Bit + Masking RAM "Writes") (but WRITING has nothing to do with this)
  8XXXXXXX ZZZZYYYY
  Checks if (YYYY) < (not (ZZZZ) & halfword at [XXXX]).
  If not, the code(s) following this one are not executed (ie. execution status is set to false) until a code type D0 or D2 is encountered, or until the end of the code list is reached.

  Equal To (Conditional 16-Bit + Masking RAM "Writes") (but WRITING has nothing to do with this)
  9XXXXXXX ZZZZYYYY
  Checks if (YYYY) == (not (ZZZZ) & halfword at [XXXX]).
  If not, the code(s) following this one are not executed (ie. execution status is set to false) until a code type D0 or D2 is encountered, or until the end of the code list is reached.

  Not Equal To (Conditional 16-Bit + Masking RAM "Writes") (but WRITING has nothing to do with this)
  AXXXXXXX ZZZZYYYY
  Checks if (YYYY) != (not (ZZZZ) & halfword at [XXXX]).
  If not, the code(s) following this one are not executed (ie. execution status is set to false) until a code type D0 or D2 is encountered, or until the end of the code list is reached.

NOTE: Above explanation is not enough, but the remaining detail is too complex to be mentioned here. So, I just only use these types.
